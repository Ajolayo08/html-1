    <h1>The learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication,</em> 
        the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. 
        This includes everything from command lines and codding to guessing keyboard shortcut, 
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there 
        are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, 
        probably more. To join our movement, sign for our official email list now.</p>
